1. Fault **Localization** is back tracking through testing outputs to find an unexpected output from the line that gave the output to the actual incorrect line

2.
- tests arent biased by code
- tests help you consider edge cases when writing code
- tests give you hindsight into what your system or program needs

3. Password requirements
   - At least a number/ no number means invalid
      - A lowercase/Upercase alphabetical character/ no characters invalid 
         - The word "gmail" cannot is not acceptable in the password
            -  Only Numbers & letters, at least one special character only being "_"

   There are many more combinations possible for paths, there is no finite set to determine
   the amount of paths for full coverage. Above I have given examples in what I consider to be
   full path coverage, though this can loop many times due to the interaction of node 3 & 4. Therefore
   there is no set number of paths.
